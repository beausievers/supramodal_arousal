## About

This repository contains code, data, and materials for running the experiments and analyses described in the paper "A supramodal code for emotional arousal," available at: https://osf.io/t82wb/

None of this code was written with the express intention of facilitating reproducible experimentation or analysis, and it is not being actively maintained. Extensive requirements are described in the file `requirements.txt`.

This repository does **NOT** contain the [Berlin Database of Emotional Speech](http://emodb.bilderbar.info/start.html) or the [PACO Body Movement Library](http://paco.psy.gla.ac.uk/index.php/res/download-data/viewcategory/5-body-movement-library), both of which are required to run the analyses for Study 4.

## File structure

- `/experiment`: materials necessary to run the studies with new participants
- `/data`: data collected from our participants
- `/analysis`: code for running analyses and generating figures
